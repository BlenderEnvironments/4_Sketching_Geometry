# 4_Sketching_Geometry
In this section we look at using a quick way to mockup worlds and create folliage Reference (BEC)

### 1 Introduction To Sketching Geometry

**In this video (objectives)…**

Mike shows you a simple scene that you'll be able to create using the new and improved Grease pencil in Blender 2.8

### 1a Issues With The Grease Pencil 

There is an Issue at the moment with the grease pencil and Blender Crashing.

This lecture will show you the way forward until the Blender developers have fixed the issue causing the crash

### 2 Adding a Grease Pencil Object

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Add a Grease Pencil object
2. Look at the options with the Grease pencil
3. Change to the different brush types


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to use the basicgrease pencil in Blender!

### 3 Setting Suitable Background Colours

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Look at how to change the Background
2. Understand when to use a light vs a dark background
3. Reason why you need to have an appropriate colour grease pencil with your chose back ground


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will have a more comfortable working environment for sketching in Blender.

### 4 Editing Grease Pencil Strokes

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Edit stokes made using the grease pencil tool
2. Great for when things new a slight adjustment
3. Use Proportional editing to manipulate your sketch

**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to modify your grease pencil after you have created it.

### 4a Quick Tip Duplicating

Michael show you a quick tip that is especially useful if you don't have a stylus.


### 5 Converting Your Sketch To A Curve

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Convert a Grease Pencil To A Curve
2. Understand the process


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to convert grease pencil sketches to curve data

### 6 Making A Curve 3 Dimensional

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Whilst keeping the curve as a curve object create real geometry
2. Explore the different options


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to use your curves as real geometry

### 7 Refining Shadows In Eevee

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Look in detail at the various shadow options
2. Understand that with thin items, Shadow detail needs to be increased
3. Cycles doesn't have these issues as the shadows occur naturally


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Be able to control Eevee's shadow settings with ease

### 8 Subsurface Scattering In Eevee

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Look at what subsurface scattering is
2. Understand that currently Eevee and Cycles produce very different results
3. Cycles produces much more realistic results
4. Turn it on in Eevee's rendering settings


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to setup and configure subsurface scattering in your materials

### 9 Drawing On A Surface

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Use the grease pencil to draw on an object's surface
2. Control the offset from that surface
3. Understand it's limitations


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to sketch upon the surface of a model

### 10 Quick Tip: Drawing Curves 

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Draw a curve rather than converting a grease pencil
2. Understand it's limitations
3. Far fewer control points to manage


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Use the mouse to sketch curves directly

### 11 Snapping To The Grease Pencil

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Use the grease pencil in a new way
2. Link our strokes to each other


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Build much more complex sketches by linking a new stroke to previous ones

### 12 Bend Angle

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Use Bend Angle
2. See that it works across many object types in Blender
3. Convert a curve into mesh


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Be able to adjust your strokes another way

### 13 Optimising And Cleanup - Dissolve

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Understand the impact when models are used repeatedly
2. Optimise our models
3. Learn about dissolving


**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

You will be able to produce models and therefore scene that are more optimised.

### 14 Drawing With Symmetry

A quick lecture showing you how to increase your speed by using the mirror modifier

### 15 Joining Curve and Mesh Data

**In this video (objectives)…**

1. Understand that you can convery curve data into mesh data
2. You can then manipulate it even further

**After watching (learning outcomes)…**

Be able to usefully convert curve data into mesh data
